                <p>I am currently a college student at the University of Maryland.
                I am majoring in both Computer Science and Mathematics as part of a dual degree.</p>
                <p>A little about myself: I love playing video games, watching sports, math blak.</p>

                    The purpose of this website is to first help me learn the entire full-stack cycle. In addition,
                    it will serve as a platform for me to deploy my applications.
                    Ideally I will eventually be containerizing my applications and hosting them
                    in the cloud, but that may take awhile.

                    This website is currently written in ReactJS. The API and backend are written in Python and Flask in an effort
                    to help me learn the language. The database is using MongoDB which is used in python through
                    pymongo. Highly reccomend all these!
