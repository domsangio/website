## Website
My First Website!!!

I am creating this website for myself to host my information and I would like it to become a git repository too. Not sure how much work will be done on this or when I can finish it but it is a work in progress. The api will be hosted in another repository.

# Technologies
The Front End will be written in React.JS
  I am used to React.JS and it is popular for making web apps in the current modern day
Back End : Python, API: Flask
  This was because originally I wanted to learn more python. I might eventually switch to a different language, but for now I am using Flask as it is incredibly easy to use.
Database: MongoDB
  I wanted to learn a DB other than SQL and Mongo has easy ability to scale up if I wanted to run large programs (Data Science?)
