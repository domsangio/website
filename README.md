# Website
My first website

I am creating this website for myself to host my information and I would like it to become a git repository too. Not sure how much work will be done on this or when I can finish it but it is a work in progress. The api will be hosted in another repository.

# Technologies
The Front End will be written in React.JS
Back End is written in python using Flask to make the API
Database is in MongoDB
